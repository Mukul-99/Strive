  "scratchpad": "Batch 22: Key Learnings & Actions:\n1. Model Enrichment and Promotion: \n   - The 'Potential' model 'Atta Chakki Machine - 18 inch, 70 kg/hr, Single Phase' was significantly enriched with a 'Motor Power: 5 HP' and 'Power Consumption: 4 units/hr' from a new product. With a complete primary spec set, it has been promoted to 'Confirmed' and renamed.\n   - The 'Potential' model 'Atta Chakki Machine - 12 inch, 15 kg/hr, Single Phase' was reinforced by a new product. Given its repeated sightings and well-defined primary specs, it has been promoted to 'Confirmed'.\n2. Model Reinforcement: \n   - The 'Atta Chakki Machine - 14 inch, 30 kg/hr, 3 HP, Single Phase' model was reinforced by a new product with matching capacity and power.\n   - The 'Atta Chakki Machine - 16 inch, 70 kg/hr, 7.5 HP, Khara Chakki' model was reinforced by a new product with matching size and capacity.\n   - The dominant 'Atta Chakki Machine - 14 inch, 50 kg/hr, 3 HP, Single Phase' model was reinforced by a product mentioning only a '14 inch' size.\n3. Spec Schema Updates: \n   - Added 'Capacity' as an original name for 'Grinding Capacity'.\n   - Added a new value '4 units/hr' to 'Power Consumption'.\n   - Increased frequencies for Motor Power (3HP, 5HP), Size (12, 14, 16, 18 inch), Grinding Capacity (15, 30, 70 kg/hr), and Phase (Single Phase).\n   - A product mentioning 'Atta Chakki Machine Body' was logged under the 'Mentioned Product Type' quaternary spec to track out-of-scope but related queries.\n4. Overall Insights: This batch was crucial for solidifying the product landscape. It allowed for the promotion of two 'Potential' models to 'Confirmed' by filling in missing primary specs or providing repeated evidence. This demonstrates the value of iterative refinement in building a robust and accurate category structure.",
